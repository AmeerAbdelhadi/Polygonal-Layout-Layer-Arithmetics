SYNOPSIS:
  Segments tree based algorithmic VLSI layout layer arithmetic operations.
  The algorithm is based on the Segments tree algorithm for finding the contour of union of rectangles.
  Input data contains polygons of diffusion and polysilicon in CIF format.
  The algorithm finds intersection and relative complement of the two layers.
  Assuming two layer, polysilion and diffusion, the algorithm finds:
  1. Pure diffusion nodes, namely diffusion minus polysilicon. (relative complement)
  2. Transistor gates, namely diffusion intersection with polysilicon. (intersection)

USAGE:
  layerArithmetics.pl -input <CIF input file> -inter <CIF intersection output file> -pdiff <CIF pure diffusion output file>

PARAMETERS:
  -input: input CIF file, contains polysilicon and diffusion layers.
  -inter: Generated output CIF file, contains intersection between polysilicon and diffusion.
  -pdiff: Generated output CIF file, contains pure diffusion.
  -ps   : Plots the segments tree graph as a PostScript file.
  >> (-input) and at least one of (-inter) and (-pdiff) are required.

EXAMPLE:
  layerArithmetics.pl -input polygons.cif -inter intersection.cif -pdiff pureDiffusion.cif -ps segmentsTree.ps
